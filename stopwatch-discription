This is the discription about stop watch  

kbhit( ):This function works by checking the keyboard buffer to see if it contain any keyboard input. This function typically uses getch( ) function to retrive the keyboard input from the buffer.  
It returns a non-zero value, indicating that a key has been pressed. If getch( ) does not find any input, it waits for the user to press a key before returning a non-zero value.  


This programm contains 6 functions:  
1-->delay(int ms): It has single parameter called ms(milliseconds), it is void return type. it is used for the delay for milliseconds meance as we know the system counts far more faster than the millisecond counting in  
    our clocks. So to make achive that delay we are using this function.  
    NOTE: The parameter we enter in this function is depends up on the system speed any may varry for different devices.
2-->content(): This function is a type of no parameters and return type. This function is used to display the contents on to the screen.  
3-->print(): This function is a type of no parameters and return type. This function is used to display the running time.  
4-->usecase(): This function is a type of no parameters and return type. This uses getch() and switch case to retrive the buffer and to change the functinality as we entered the corresopnding input ex:start, stop,...etc.  
5-->conter(): This function is a type of no parameters and return type. This uses kbhit() and this is used to update the time.  
6-->main(): This is the main function.
